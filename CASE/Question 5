We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first in your final table.


SELECT s.name,COUNT(o.id),
		CASE WHEN COUNT(o.id) > 200 THEN 'TOP'
        WHEN COUNT(o.id) < 200 THEN 'NOT'
        END AS top_sales_rep
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id=a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
