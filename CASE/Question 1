Write a query to display for each order, the account ID, total amount of the order, and the level of the order - ‘Large’ or ’Small’ - depending on if the order is $3000 or more, or smaller than $3000.

SELECT total_amt_usd,account_id,
	CASE WHEN total_amt_usd < 3000 THEN 'SMALL'
    ELSE 'LARGE' END AS SIZE
FROM orders;
