Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. What proportion of company names start with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?



WITH counts AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN LEFT(name, 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') THEN 'StartsWithVowels'
            ELSE 'Others'
        END AS difference,
        COUNT(*) AS Countss
    FROM accounts
    GROUP BY difference

               FROM counts
               WHERE difference = 'StartsWithVowels'),

                    FROM counts
                    WHERE difference = 'Others'),
