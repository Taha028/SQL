Use the accounts table and a CASE statement to create two groups: one group of company names that start with a number and a second group of those company names that start with a letter. What proportion of company names start with a letter?




WITH counts AS (SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN LEFT(name, 1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'Z' THEN 'Letter'
        WHEN LEFT(name, 1) BETWEEN '0' AND '9' THEN 'DIGIT'
    END AS difference,
    COUNT(*) AS Countss
FROM accounts
GROUP BY difference)

SELECT SUM(Countss)*1.0/
(SELECT SUM(Countss)
 FROM counts) AS all_sum
FROM counts
WHERE difference = 'Letter'
